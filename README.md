A cross-platform game engine for developing 2D games using Monogame, Farseer physics and Lidgren

##Developement Progress

Gem Network is not fully tested and not ready to use. 
Gem Gui API is likely to change.
Gem Engine is still in early development.

##Description

###Gem Network
A standalone library for client server applications using network sockets. Gem Network extends Lidgren Network, offering an easy to use API for creating network events and a configurable and expendable server console for executing remote commands

Documentation for Gem Network can be found [here](https://github.com/gmich/Gem/wiki/Gem.Network)

###Gem GUI
A library to render GUI controls in Monogame applications. Gem Gui supports the basic control events for mouse / keyboard / controller / touch input. The control's style is easily customisable. You can also assing controls into layout groups for automatic alignment that responds to window and resolution changes.

Documentation and how to get started can be found [here](https://github.com/gmich/Gem/wiki/Gem-Gui)
